# UML2 SP: Object-oriented simulation language
The UML-profile intend for the development of simulation models.

We opinion, the language useful to scientific simulation. The UML2 SP describe object of study as an ontology, i.e. as non-numeric model. This useful if the mathematical model of object is not known. The ontology can be investigate simulation method.
Also, the language can be used to technical simulation, however, this is more expensive than the GPSS or AnyLogic simulation but it is justified if the high quality of the model is necessary.<br/>
We belif, the UML2 SP useful into area of higher education to study of simulation and preparation of dissertations.

For work with UML2 SP need know object-oriented analysis and design, UML, Unified Process, design patterns, and anyone object-oriented program language.

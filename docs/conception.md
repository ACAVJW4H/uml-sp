# Conception UML2 SP

A foundation UML2 SP consist a three principles: communicative paradigm, double semantics and semiotic approach.

**Communicative paradigm.** 
Any object of reality is a communicative process consist a communicative acts. It is an abstraction like a matematical abstration.

**Semiotic approach.** 
The triangle of reference (a semantic triangle) is a triangle: Symbol—Meaning— Thing (a referent). The triangle we consider as a model of stereotype. It is abstract stereotype “AbstractConceptualElement”. The “referent” is a stereotype, the “meaning” is a tagged value of “Concept”, and “symbol” is a tagged value of “ID”. All stereotypes of UML2 SP are children AbstractConceptualElement stereotype.

**Double semantics.** Any element of UML2 SP has a dauble semantics: application domain semantics and computinal semantics. An object  is a communicative process and a computinal simulator is communicative process. In simulation a communicative process is general abstration.

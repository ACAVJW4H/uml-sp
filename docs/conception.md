# Conception UML2 SP

A foundation UML2 SP consist a three principles: communicative paradigm, double semantics, and semiotic approach.

**Communicative paradigm.** 
Any object of reality is a communicative process consist a communicative acts. It is an abstraction like a matematical abstration.
We regard the history of object-oriented approach as history of discovery of discrete world.

**Semiotic approach.** 
The triangle of reference (a semantic triangle) is a triangle: Symbol—Meaning— Thing (a referent). The triangle we consider as a model of stereotype. It is abstract stereotype *AbstractConceptualElement*. The “referent” is a stereotype, the “meaning” is a tagged value of *Concept*, and “symbol” is a tagged value of *ID*. All stereotypes of UML2 SP are children `AbstractConceptualElement` stereotype.
For example, the “author The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” situation  is modeled as
<p><img src="define/MarkTwin.png" alt="" /></p>

(but if *Concept = Human* for *Leaf* then *Concept = A man is human* and *ID = Samuel Clemens*  for *leaf* object; Mark Twain is the pseudonym Samuel Clemens).


**Double semantics.** Any element of UML2 SP has a dauble semantics: application domain semantics and computinal semantics. An object  is a communicative process and a computinal simulation is communicative process. In simulation a communicative process is general abstration.

In application domain semantics Analysis Class Diagram is an ontology of application domain. In computinal semantics Analysis Class Diagram is model of program.

## Introduction

## Application domain

Figure 1. The class diagram<br/>

## Analysis model
A conceptual model in UML2 SP is an analysis class diagram. This diagram considered as ontology. 
Model the fractal is depicted in Fig.2.

<p><img src="ClassDiagram.png" alt="" /></p>
Figure 2. The class diagram<br/>
We shall give definition of concepts to the ontology.

#### Topological Space
The “Component” frame define “Topological Space
” concept. The frame has «left and right» slots. It is defined "coupling" notion.
### Verification

Figure 3. Results of measurement to simulation model<br/>

### The simulation model in C# code:  
[ClockClass.cs](https://github.com/vgurianov/uml-sp/blob/master/examples/clock/ClockClass.cs) 

## Alternative model of analysis 
A conceptual model in UML2 SP is an analysis class diagram. This diagram considered as ontology. 
Model the fractal is depicted in Fig.3.

## Conclusion
In this section considered object model of the Koch snowflake. This model can use to construct other fractals such as the Cantor ternary set and more complex.<br/>

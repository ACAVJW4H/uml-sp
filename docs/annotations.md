# About UML2 SP
A simulation include next steps:
1. define goals modeling and requirements to simulator
2. conceptual modeling
3. formal describe
4. programing
5. verification and validation
6. make general plan of experiments
7. make up tactical plan and execute experiment
8. analyze results of experiments

UML2 SP support three first step.

# Simple example
## Application domain: Greeting
-- Good morning, Mr. Goldsmith. It’s been a long time since we met. How nice to see you again.<br/>
-- How do you do, Mr. Brown. I’m glad to see you too. How are you?<br/>
-- Not bad, thank you /Thanks, not so well.

## 1. Define goals modeling and requirements to simulator
In UML2 SP this step is a Use-Case model. Use-Case model is an artefact of Requirement workflow.<br/>
Goal: What will Mr. Brown answer?<br/>
Plan of experiment: asks Mr. Brown


## 2. Conceptual modeling
In UML2 SP this step is a Analysis model. Analysis model is an artefact of Analysis workflow.

## 3. Formal describe
In UML2 SP this step is a Design model.Design model is an artefact of Design workflow.
